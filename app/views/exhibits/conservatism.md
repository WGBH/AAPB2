Historic preservation is more than just saving old buildings from the bulldozer. Histories can be shared or silenced depending upon the preservation of places that represent a larger story. Historic preservationists have long used public broadcasting to make history tangible through buildings and landscapes across America. National programs, local news and magazine shows, radio call-ins, and interviews reveal the remarkable and ordinary places Americans have used to share stories about their communities. Looking at broad themes in historic preservation, this exhibit will explore the many ways Americans have created a dialogue through public media about these places that embody local and national histories.

Conservative journalist Noel Parmentel Jr. was not optimistic about the future of American conservatism. In a 1963 National Educational Television (NET) telecast, [*The American Conservative*](cpb-aacip_512-r785h7cx44), Parmentel lamented the noble fight but dim prospects for success of the American right. “Pulling for the right wing in the end,” he stated, “is like pulling for the New York Mets.” He continued, “It’s the Alamo, it’s the German Army at Stalingrad, it’s Horatio at the bridge.” This view would have resonated with many American conservatives in the early 1960s. They perceived conservatism as a necessary refutation of the postwar liberal consensus and saw mainstream American institutions – especially the major political parties, the mainstream media, and higher education – as so hostile to conservative views that the fight for influence within them would be Herculean. 

Conservatives in the decades after World War II were part of a heterogeneous movement, bound together in part by this shared sense of grievance and outsider status. Opposed to the expansion of federal power inaugurated during the New Deal, hostile to a modern secularism that seemed to reject traditional sites of authority, suspicious of a Cold War foreign policy understood to be insufficiently aggressive in its fight against the spread of global communism, fearful of the expansion of collectivism domestically, and outraged by an increasing permissiveness that tolerated civil disobedience and disrespect for the nation’s laws, conservatives adamantly believed that the country was headed in multiple wrong directions. 

The nomination of conservative senator Barry Goldwater in 1964 as the Republican candidate for president seemingly proved Parmentel wrong. Goldwater’s nomination signaled an early victory for conservatives seeking to move the party, and the nation, to the right; yet Goldwater’s staggering electoral defeat indicated that conservatives still had work to do to make their ideas and ideology attractive to a larger public. Over the course of the 1960s, but especially in the second half of the decade, NET would dedicate a number of telecasts to this burgeoning movement and accordingly would provide a remarkable window into the history of conservatism, especially in the period in which conservatives were in the process of building the institutions and influence that later would enable them to become a major political force from the end of the 1970s onward. 

The shows in this exhibit are diverse aesthetically and ideologically, as they explored conservatism from myriad vantage points. The singular show in this exhibit from the 1950s, an episode of a Syracuse University program [*Books and Ideas*](cpb-aacip_512-j96057ds7h), offered a discussion of Cornell University professor Clinton Rossiter’s book Conservatism in America. NET returned to the discussion format in 1970 when it dedicated five episodes to the exploring the conservative viewpoint on US [foreign policy](cpb-aacip_512-5717m04t96), [law and order](cpb-aacip_512-7659c6sv00), [politics](cpb-aacip_512-b27pn8z80v), and [morality](cpb-aacip_512-vh5cc0vx37). These episodes put leading conservative intellectuals, journalists, and politicians in dialogue with one another and with moderator Sidney Hyman, who often sought to clarify how conservatism differed from the liberal consensus that had dominated American political culture since the end of World War II.

Two episodes were part of *Regional Report*, a bimonthly series launched by NET in 1964. *Regional Report* episodes were composed of distinct segments produced by local NET affiliates on a common topic. This format demonstrated how exigent national issues were experienced differently in local communities, introduced the national NET audience to local journalists and persons of interests and, through the diversity of approaches taken by the local stations for the segments for which they were responsible, illuminated myriad approaches to public affairs reporting. The [*Regional Report* on the John Birch Society (JBS)](cpb-aacip_512-ft8df6m068), for example, included interviews with leaders of the organization, investigations into the impact of the JBS in communities where its members had risen to prominence in important institutions, and a segment in which members of a JBS chapter in Massachusetts performed for NET cameras a JBS meeting that they had prepared and rehearsed in advance.

NET’s programs also offered profiles on significant conservative figures. William F. Buckley Jr. – founder of *National Review*, New York city mayoral candidate, later host of the long-running *Firing Line*, author of a number of books, and arguably the nation’s most prominent conservative intellectual in the 1960s – was the subject of a 1969 episode of [*NET Journal*](cpb-aacip_75-35gb5qv3), NET’s flagship public affairs program in the late 1960s. Buckley also appeared prominently in two earlier NET programs – a film of his [1964 debate with author and intellectual James Baldwin at the Cambridge Union](cpb-aacip_151-sn00z71m54) telecast on NET in 1965 and as guest on [*What’s Happening, Mr. Silver*](cpb-aacip/15-27zkhbbv), an experimental show out of WGBH that ran for two seasons. 

Each of the episodes provided viewers a different view of Buckley, though there is a consistency of his ideas that recur across the programs. In his debate with Baldwin – which he lost, according both to the students in attendance at the time and to the majority of historians who have since studied the debate – Buckley defended the United States, its history and its guiding principles, as the best guarantor of racial justice against Baldwin’s claims of the material, psychic, and spiritual consequences of racism on both black and white Americans. The *Mr. Silver* episode put the series’ eponymous host and Buckley in a room filled with photographs and painting hanging from the ceiling, the two men roaming around the space and pausing to discuss each image, a conversation that elicited Buckley’s views on topics ranging from the merits of the Beatles and the film *Bonnie and Clyde*, his views on psychedelic drugs, and his opinion of Richard Nixon. The *NET Journal* episode blended a range of techniques, such footage of Buckley speaking at public events, a voiceover of Buckley reading his published pieces, and a segment in which Buckley discusses diversity and education with Urban League leader Whitney Young. 

*NET Journal* also dedicated an [episode to H.L. Hunt](cpb-aacip_512-j96057dt9d), one of the richest men in the United States who dedicated time and money to advancing conservative ideas. The profile blended interviews with Hunt along with segments outlining his business interests and use of media to advance conservatism and footage of Hunt both at work and at home. It also included, as it had not with its profile of Buckley, interviews with some of Hunt’s critics who raised alarms about Hunt’s use of his vast wealth, in the minds of the interviewees, to promulgate false and dangerous ideas. 

California governor, and later president, Ronald Reagan was featured in a 1967 episode of [*Public Broadcasting Laboratory* (*PBL*)](cpb-aacip/15-94hmh6vt). *PBL* was distributed by NET but, as per former NET president James Day, was not of NET. The series, funded by the Ford Foundation, was created by former CBS producer Fred Friendly and helmed by CBS News producer Av Westin. *PBL* was intended to be an experimental magazine program that would be telecast simultaneously across interconnected educational television stations. Its premiere episode, which included a number of segments on racism in the US, provoked concern and disappointment from a range of stakeholders, including Friendly, over especially its inclusion of Douglas Ward Howe’s play *Day of Absence*, which featured African American performers in whiteface in a story about a town whose African American community disappeared overnight. 

The Reagan *PBL* episode was in essence a direct cinema documentary of Reagan’s time as a CHUBB Fellow at Yale. While the episode provided a number of scenes in which Reagan debated with students a range of issues, perhaps what was most notable about program is the increased skepticism expressed by students and faculty alike – both directly to Reagan and in moments away from him – about his grasp of key issues and his intellectual acumen. Reagan was gracious throughout, and it is an open question as to whether the episode asked viewers to identify with him or with the many people in the episode who doubted his intelligence.

This exhibit also contains all six episodes of *The Radical Americans* which explored, as NET communicated to its affiliates, “What the left and right wing radicals have to offer as solutions, the means they use to proselytize their views, and the real motivations and historical impact of their power are probed in the series.”  Two of the six episodes -- ["Voices from the Right"](cpb-aacip_512-445h990541) and ["The Right Takes Over"](cpb-aacip_15-03qvbh5c) -- were dedicated to right-wing organizations, and a [third](cpb-aacip_512-tq5r786p84) contrasted left-wing and right-wing colleges. By design, the series suggested an equivalence across these forms of radicalism, which in their most extreme manifestations were presented as threatening to American life.

In sum, what emerges across the episodes in this exhibit is a diversity in both approaches to documenting the conservative movement and in assessments of its impact on US politics. Some shows positioned conservatism as a worldview rooted in an identifiable set of principles about the proper role of government in domestic and international affairs; others profiled significant and charismatic conservative leaders as a means to give face and form to the movement; still others situated conservatism within a broader 1960s political culture in which members of the left and right attacked the postwar liberal consensus and the institutions that constituted its power base; and some considered the realignment of American politics in the face of the increasing political power of the conservative wing of the Republican Party symbolized by Goldwater’s candidacy in 1964.

In addition, the NET programs provide a complex view into how public media tried to make sense of the conservative movement in this period when, as per Parmentel, its future was unclear. Taken together, there is no singular view of conservatism on offer in the broadcasts in this exhibit. While, in *The American Conservative*, Clinton Rossiter traced the history of US conservatism to the nation’s founding, other telecasts positioned contemporary manifestations of the right as threats to democracy and liberty. Though the conversations that took place across the Conservative Viewpoint series uncovered the intellectual foundations of conservatism, other broadcasts cast suspicions on the intellectual acumen of conservative political figures rising to national prominence. If some NET shows legitimated conservatism as a serious intellectual and political movement, others signaled that particular iterations of the right were harbingers of disaster for American democracy.
