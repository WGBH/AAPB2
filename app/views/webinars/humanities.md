## Summary

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), a collaboration between the Library of Congress and WGBH, preserves historic programming created by public media and provides a central web portal for access to these unique programs. Over 50,000 items are available in the AAPB Online Reading Room, including coverage of the [Watergate Hearings](/exhibits/watergate), education, [women’s](/special_collections/woman-series) and [LGBTQ history](/special_collections/lgbt), [climate change](/exhibits/climate-change), [elections](/exhibits/presidential-elections) and civics, [protesting in America](/exhibits/first-amendment), [social movements](/exhibits/civil-rights), cultural events, [local history](/participating-orgs) and much more!

The ‘Use of AAPB in Humanities Research’ webinar covers how scholars access and use public media archives, how to teach them to students, and mine them as a dataset for text, audio waveform analysis, image recognition, and machine learning.

**Webinar objectives include**:
